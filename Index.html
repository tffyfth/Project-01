                <h1 class="sub-title">About Me</h1>
                <p>I am Tiffany Faith Dalaya, a second-year student at National Teacher College studying BSIT. Besides being burned out from studying, I sometimes engage in something to relieve stress and have fun.<br> 
                    K-pop music is something I really enjoy listening to. I like to watch <br>K-pop idols sing and dance. K-pop, or Korean pop music, is a well-known genre of music that originated in South Korea. 
                    In K-pop, there are many delightful songs, dances, fashions, beauty trends, and other social media trends. K-pop artists make my day complete because they make me smile and laugh. <br>
                    <br>I also enjoy watching Korean drama, or Kdrama, whenever I have a lot of free time or it is my day of relaxation. I can complete every episode in a single day. Every Korean drama that is produced has plots, genres, casts, and cinematography that I absolutely enjoy. 
                    They have a clever and original strategy for getting viewers to enjoy and watch the drama. <br> 
                    <br>I also read stories from Wattpad and Jonaxx Stories online when I'm under pressure at school. I enjoy reading romance novels, especially fantasy and slow-burning love romances. Reading my favorite stories makes me feel better since the characters are interesting and I can relate to them. When I feel like I can only rely on myself, this helps me have a source of bonding, and reading stories can boost my energy and mood. In this Website I will share to you these things that I like whenever I feel stressed. I have some of my Favorite K-pop and K-dramas and also I have recommended stories that you can read online. </p>

                <h2>Heartless</h2>
                <p>This book for me is wonderful. It's just that it could be a little problematic for others. Jonaxx stories needs a very critical thinking because the idea that you grasp will only be stuck at bad or good nothing in between. Same with this book, if you have a weak mindset and easy to falter stands you'll take wrong idea.</p>

                <i class="fa-solid fa-book" style="color: #c49235;"></i>
                <h2>Charm Academy</h2>
                <p>First book ever that I've read on Wattpad and I'm grateful that this particular story was first one I had read cause it created such memorable reading moments for me. Plot was fun and great!</p>
              
            </div>
            <div>
                <a href="images/Sypnosis3.jpg"><img src="images/everybeastneedsabeauty.jpg" ></a>
                <i class="fa-solid fa-book" style="color: #c49235;"></i>
                <h2>Every Beast Needs A Beauty</h2>
                <p> At first, I was really hesitating to read this on Wattpad. But I took those words back when I read the 7 chapters spontaneously without stopping. I had a hard time understanding other vocabularies, but I still survived! Just like her other stories, every chapter is full of scenes that will keep you reading and reading without getting bored. I recommend you to read this 10/10. If you love cliché with a little bit of spice, you have to read this.</p>

            <div>
                <a href="images/Sypnosis4.jpg"><img src="images/giveintoyou.jpg" ></a>
                <i class="fa-solid fa-book" style="color: #c49235;"></i>
                <h2>Give In To You</h2>
                <p>I got more feels in this story. I felt the characters emotions more as well. All the emotions, sensations that this story made me feel—I’ll never forget them. The way it made the butterflies in my stomach burst, the way it made me feel annoyed, frustrated, & the ultra mega super duper kilig that I felt—it’ll forever stay in my system. This story made me cuss countless of times because there are points where all I could do is to curse those certain characters and wish they were dead.</p>

                <i class="fa-solid fa-book" style="color: #c49235;"></i>
                <h2>Olympus Academy</h2>
                <p>A great way to read a whole series that was fun and entertaining.  Though I am not always sure who is who sometimes. Add in the mystery, suspense, and trying to survive and wow what a series. A great blend of mythology, magic, quests, enemies, creatures and teenage angst and you get a great academy series.</p>

                <i class="fa-solid fa-book" style="color: #c49235;"></i>
                <h2>Training To Love</h2>
                <p>his is absolutely one of my favorite stories in Wattpad. Well, it is actually recommended to read this book first before trying the latter. But no worries, for the latter is still understandable even if you haven’t read this book yet. It was a well written story. I don’t even think there’s something I can complain of. This is absolutely not your typical cliché story. The story line was great and the plot is beautifully executed. There are of course a lot of extra sweet lines in the story but I salute the author for not letting it sounds too cheesy or too corny.</p>
